# Dataset

This is a premier league 23-24 dataset that has the matches played up until the 26 gameweek. It has variables such as Captain, team played, who they played, result, venue, Refree, shots, shots on target, etc
I think this could be interesting to see if there is any relation to the refrees and maybe higher shots.
I got this data set from Ilse Flores and it is called Proyecto CD Premiere League
